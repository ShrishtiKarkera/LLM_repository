# Uses Mistral 7b Instruct with Langchain for querying and FAISS as the vector database

You can reuse the code by:
1. Cloning the repo
2. You can add your own documents or pdfs in the data folder and make sure the file path is correct
3. You can also use your own vector store, I've used the database by Meta - https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/faiss-tutorial/
4. Run the notebook as is in Google Colab for free
