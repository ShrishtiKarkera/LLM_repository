For one thing, he\\nhated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\\nIt was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the\\nblankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one handand a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of hiseagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for somethingthat would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the FourteenthCentury Was Completely Pointless discuss.\"\\nThe quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed\\nhis round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closerto the book, and read:\\nNon-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly\\nafraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burninghad no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basicFlame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoyinga gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed beingburned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less thanfortyseven times in various disguises.\\nHarry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow\\nfor his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully heunscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleysheard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he\\'dprobably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for therest of the summer.\\nThe Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that\\nHarry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/Harry Potter - Book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='2their son, Dudley, were Harry\\'s only living relatives. They were\\nMuggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry\\'sdead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were nevermentioned under the Dursleys\\' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and UncleVernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,they would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, theyhad been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone findingout that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts Schoolof Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lockaway Harry\\'s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start ofthe summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.\\nThis separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,\\nbecause his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, wasfor Harry\\'s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would bedelighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harryhad therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. WhileUncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the frontgarden to admire Uncle Vernon\\'s new company car (in very loud voices, sothat the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had creptdownstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbedsome of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\\'tleave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that hewas studying magic by night.\\nHarry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at\\nthe moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, allbecause he\\'d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one weekinto the school vacation.\\nRon Weasley, who was one of Harry\\'s best friends at Hogwarts, came from\\na whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harrydidn\\'t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it hadbeen Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.\\n\"Vernon Dursley speaking.\"Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard\\nRon\\'s voice answer.', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/Harry Potter - Book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='3\"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO --\\nHARRY-- POTTER!\"\\nRon was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver\\na foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingledfury and alarm.\\n\"WHO IS THIS?\" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \"WHO ARE\\nYOU?\"\\n\"RON -- WEASLEY!\" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were\\nspeaking from opposite ends of a football field. \"I\\'M -- A -- FRIEND --OF -- HARRY\\'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --\"\\nUncle Vernon\\'s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to\\nthe spot.\\n\"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!\" he roared, now holding the receiver\\natarm\\'s length, as though frightened it might explode. \"I DON\\'T KNOW WHATSCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN!DON\\'T YOU COME NEARMY FAMILY!\"\\nAnd he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a\\npoisonous spider.\\nThe fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.\"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE\\nYOU!\" UncleVernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.\\nRon obviously realized that he\\'d gotten Harry into trouble, because he\\nhadn\\'t called again. Harry\\'s other best friend from Hogwarts, HermioneGranger, hadn\\'t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron hadwarned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, thecleverest witch in Harry\\'s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/Harry Potter - Book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content=\"4how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to\\nsay that she went to Hogwarts.\\nSo Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long\\nweeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the lastone. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that hewouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had beenallowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given inbecause of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all thetime.\\nHarry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen\\nagain. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finishthis essay tomorrow night....\\nHe replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from\\nunder his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill,and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loosefloorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked thetime on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.\\nIt was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He\\nhad been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.\\nYet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward\\nto his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. TheDursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had noreason to suppose they would remember this one.\\nHarry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to\\nthe open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant onhis face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absentfor two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone thislong before. But he hoped she'd be back soon -- she was the only livingcreature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him.\\nHarry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few\\ninches over the last year.

The eyes\\nbehind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearlyvisible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt oflightning.\\nOf all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most\\nextraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for tenyears, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents,because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had beenmurdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing morethan a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killinghim, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort hadfled....\\nBut Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their\\nlast meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he waslucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.\\nHe scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaringback to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.\\nGazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harryrealized what he was seeing.\\nSilhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,\\nwas a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry'sdirection. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For asplit second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wonderingwhether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over oneof the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,leapt aside.\\nThrough the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,\\nwhich appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump onHarry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled rightover and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.\\nHarry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his name was Errol, and\\nhe belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the\", metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/Harry Potter - Book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='6cords around Errol\\'s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol\\nto Hedwig\\'s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot ofthanks, and began to gulp some water.\\nHarry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy\\nfemale, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and lookedextremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip withher beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to joinErrol.\\nHarry didn\\'t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew\\nat once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relievedthis owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretchedits wings, and took off through the window into the night.\\nHarry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol\\'s package, ripped off the\\nbrown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his firstever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.\\nThe clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily\\nProphet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving.Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:\\nMINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZEArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the\\nMinistry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize GalleonDraw.\\nA delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \"We will be spending the\\ngold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works asa curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\"\\nThe Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the\\nstart of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasleychildren currently attend.\\nHarry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Data/Harry Potter - Book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content=\"7as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in\\nfront of a large pyramid.

Right in the middle ofthe picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, onhis shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.\\nHarry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold\\nmore than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor.

Harry didn\\'t have to do his homeworkunder the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the brightsunshine outside Florean Fortescue\\'s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all hisessays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apartfrom knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry freesundaes every half an hour.\\nOnce Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver\\nSickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had toexercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. Hehad to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts,and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, tostop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (awizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt anasty-smelling liquid into the other player\\'s face when they lose apoint).
